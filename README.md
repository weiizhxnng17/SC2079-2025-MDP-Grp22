## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized into modular folders representing each system component:

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **stm/** | Embedded firmware for the STM microcontroller controlling robot movement and sensors. |
| **algo/** | Core algorithm logic, including path-planning, exploration, shortest path, and task execution modules. |
| **algo/simulator/** | Frontend simulator built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for visualizing robot movement and debugging algorithms. |
| **rpi/** | Raspberry Pi interface code handling serial and network communication between STM, PC, and Android tablet. |
| **image_recognition/** | YOLO-based image detection and arrow/marker recognition pipeline used for Task 2. |
| **android/** | Android application used to control the robot remotely and display live updates. |
