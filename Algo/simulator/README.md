## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

Start the app by

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be running at `localhost:3000`

## Usage

Position the robot where you want it to be and click on the buttons to add obstacles. Then click on `Submit` to find the path, or `Reset All` to clear the map and put the robot back to the starting position. `Reset Robot` just resets the robot to the starting position without clearing the map.



You can also add obstacles without a symbol card by choosing the 'None' option for the direction.


Use the left and right arrow buttons to go through the path step by step to see how the algorithm is working.
